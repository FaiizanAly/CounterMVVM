# CounterMVVM

A simple Counter App built using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** that demonstrates the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture. This app allows users to increment and decrement a counter value while adhering to clean architecture principles.

---

## Features
- **Increment and Decrement Counter**: Update the counter value using buttons.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Separation of UI and business logic for maintainable code.
- **Jetpack Compose UI**: Modern declarative UI framework.
- **State Management**: Uses `MutableState` to handle UI state effectively.

---

## Architecture
The app follows the **MVVM architecture**, ensuring separation of concerns:
1. **Model**: Represents the counter data.
2. **View**: Displays the UI using Jetpack Compose.
3. **ViewModel**: Handles the state and logic for the counter.
